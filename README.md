Counting Occurrences in ARM Assembly
Objective:
• Write an ARM assembly program to count the occurrences of bytes from data2 within data1.
• Utilize the provided base addresses for data1 (0x10000000 - X0) and data2 (0x20000000 - X1).
Requirements:
Data Initialization:
• data 1 - 1234 2468 3702 4936 6170
• data 2 - 3435 3637
• Declare two arrays, datal and data2, with the provided values.
• Use the base addresses 0x10000000 for data1 and 0×20000000 for data2.
Counting Occurrences:
• Use the base addresses of data1 and data2 to store the data.
• Count the occurrences of each byte from data2 within data1 totally.
• Store the total number of occurrences in X5 register.
Comments and Documentation:
• Provide clear comments and documentation explaining each section of your code.
• Include information about the data structure and any design decisions.
• Submit as a text directly in blackboard.
